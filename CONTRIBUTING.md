# Contributing to Competer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Competer! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/competer-miniapp.git
   cd competer-miniapp
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up your development environment following the README instructions

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier for code formatting
- **Linting**: Follow ESLint rules
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic and business rules

### Architecture Principles

1. **Frontend First**: Keep business logic in the frontend when possible
2. **Minimal Backend**: Backend should focus on data persistence and API calls
3. **Type Safety**: Use Zod schemas for validation and type inference
4. **Component Reusability**: Create reusable components in the components directory

### Database Changes

1. **Schema First**: Always update `shared/schema.ts` first
2. **Migrations**: Use `npm run db:push` for schema changes
3. **Relations**: Explicitly model all relations using Drizzle relations
4. **Validation**: Update Zod schemas when changing database structure

## Submitting Changes
